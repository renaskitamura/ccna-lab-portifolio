From Kitchens to CLI: My CCNA Lab Portfolio

### Introduction
Welcome! My name is Renato and I am an aspiring **IT Technical Support Specialist** currently transitioning from a career in the culinary arts. After completing the **Google IT Support Professional Certificate** (Oct/2025), I am now deep-diving into networking fundamentals to earn my **CCNA**.

This repository is my "digital notebook", documenting the labs I build, the networks I break, and the solutions I engineer.

### Why a Chef in IT?
My background in professional kitchens has prepared me for IT in unexpected ways:
* **Mise en place (Preparation):** Just as I prep my station, I plan my network topologies and subnets before typing a single command.
* **Troubleshooting under pressure:** I am trained to solve problems immediately during a dinner rush; now I apply that calmness to troubleshooting connectivity issues.
* **Adherence to SOPs:** I follow documentation and protocols rigorously to ensure consistent results.

### What's Inside?
I am documenting my progress through the CCNA exam topics:
* **Network Access:** VLANs, Trunking, Spanning Tree Protocol (STP).
* **IP Connectivity:** OSPF v2, Static Routing, IP routing tables.
* **IP Services:** DHCP, DNS, SNMP, NTP.
* **Security:** ACLs, Port Security, VPN concepts.

### Sample Lab Structure
For every project, I include:
* `Topology.png` (Visual setup)
* `Config.txt` (The CLI commands used)
* `Notes.md` (What I learned & how I fixed errors)
